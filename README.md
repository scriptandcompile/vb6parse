# Goals:

VB6Parse aims to be a complete, end-to-end parser library for VB6. Including, but not limited to:

* (*.vbp) VB6 project files.
* (*.bas) VB6 module files.
* (*.vbw) VB6 windows files for determining IDE editor windows and where they are opened.
* (*.frm) VB6 Form files.
* (*.frx) VB6 Form Resource files.
* (*.dsx) VB6 Data Environment files.
* (*.dsr) VB6 Data Environment Resource files.
* (*.cls) VB6 Class files.
* (*.ctl) VB6 User Control files.
* (*.ctx) VB6 User Control Resource files.
* (*.ttx) Crystal Report files.
* (*.dob) User Document files.

## Current support:

First work has focused on the (vbp) project files since is the method to discover all other files that should be linked/referenced within a project.

 **note**: The form currently loads resources from the frx file, but doesn't apply all of them to the correct property locations in all cases yet. 
Instead of creating a picture and assigning it to the Picture property, we only load the binary blob from the FRX file and assign it to the property parsing bag.

Further work is needed to correctly assign the binary resources to the their properties in the standard controls.
