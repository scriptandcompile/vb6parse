If you're unfamiliar with Git or GitHub, here is a brief overview of the many ways you can access these projects:
- Individual files can be browsed online by clicking on file/folder names
- The entire repository can be downloaded as a .zip file by using the green "Clone or download" button
- For best results, I recommend forking your own copy of the repository, using the "Fork" button.  This gives you your own copy to play with / modify / build as you see fit.

Pre-compiled Windows executables are provided for all projects.  If you're paranoid, feel free to ignore/remove these from your own repo, and manually build all code.  (A copy of the VB6 IDE will be required.)

Questions, comments, feedback, etc can be filed as issues.  Pull requests are also welcome.
