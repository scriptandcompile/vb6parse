If you're unfamiliar with Git or GitHub, here is a brief overview of the many ways you can access this project:
- Individual files can be browsed online by clicking on file/folder names
- The entire code collection can be downloaded as a .zip file by visiting [the root repository folder](https://github.com/tannerhelland/vb6-code), then clicking the green "Clone or download" button on the right.
- For best results, I recommend forking your own copy of the repository, using the "Fork" button in the top-right.  This gives you your own copy of the source code to experiment with / modify / build as you see fit.

Pre-compiled Windows executables are provided for all projects.  For the paranoid, feel free to ignore or remove these, then manually build each project yourself.  (A copy of the VB6 IDE will obviously be required.)

Questions, comments, feedback, etc can be [filed as issues](https://github.com/tannerhelland/vb6-code/issues).  [Pull requests](https://github.com/tannerhelland/vb6-code/pulls) are also welcome.
