            <p>VB6 <code>Weekday</code> Function
The <code>Weekday</code> function returns a Variant (Integer) specifying a whole number representing the day of the week.</p>
<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>
<pre><code class="language-vbnet">Weekday(date[, firstdayofweek])</code></pre>
<h2 id="parameters">Parameters</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>date</code>: Required. Variant, numeric expression, string expression, or any combination that can represent a date. If <code>date</code> contains Null, Null is returned.</li>
<li><code>firstdayofweek</code>: Optional. A constant that specifies the first day of the week. If not specified, vbSunday is assumed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="firstdayofweek-constants"><code>FirstDayOfWeek</code> Constants</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>vbUseSystem</code> (0): Use the system setting</li>
<li><code>vbSunday</code> (1): Sunday (default)</li>
<li><code>vbMonday</code> (2): Monday</li>
<li><code>vbTuesday</code> (3): Tuesday</li>
<li><code>vbWednesday</code> (4): Wednesday</li>
<li><code>vbThursday</code> (5): Thursday</li>
<li><code>vbFriday</code> (6): Friday</li>
<li><code>vbSaturday</code> (7): Saturday</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="returns">Returns</h2>
<p>Returns a <code>Variant (Integer)</code> from 1 to 7 representing the day of the week:
- When <code>firstdayofweek</code> is <code>vbSunday</code> (default): 1=Sunday, 2=Monday, 3=Tuesday, 4=Wednesday, 5=Thursday, 6=Friday, 7=Saturday
- When <code>firstdayofweek</code> is <code>vbMonday</code>: 1=Monday, 2=Tuesday, 3=Wednesday, 4=Thursday, 5=Friday, 6=Saturday, 7=Sunday
- The numbering adjusts based on which day is specified as the first day of the week</p>
<h2 id="remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The <code>Weekday</code> function determines which day of the week a date falls on:
- <strong>Return value range</strong>: Always 1-7, where 1 represents the first day of the week
- <strong>Default first day</strong>: Sunday (vbSunday = 1) if not specified
- <strong>Null handling</strong>: Returns Null if date contains Null
- <strong>Date parsing</strong>: Accepts various date formats (strings, numbers, Date types)
- <strong>Zero-based alternative</strong>: Use <code>(Weekday(date) - 1)</code> for 0-6 range if needed
- <strong>System setting</strong>: vbUseSystem (0) uses Windows regional settings
- <strong>International support</strong>: firstdayofweek allows cultural calendar preferences
- <strong>Combine with <code>DateSerial</code></strong>: Calculate specific weekdays</p>
<h3 id="understanding-return-values">Understanding Return Values</h3>
<p>The return value changes based on <code>firstdayofweek</code>:
- With <code>vbSunday</code> (default): Sunday=1, Monday=2, ..., Saturday=7
- With <code>vbMonday</code>: Monday=1, Tuesday=2, ..., Sunday=7
- With <code>vbTuesday</code>: Tuesday=1, Wednesday=2, ..., Monday=7
- And so on for other starting days</p>
<h3 id="common-usage-patterns">Common Usage Patterns</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weekend detection</strong>: <code>Weekday(date) = vbSaturday Or Weekday(date) = vbSunday</code></li>
<li><strong>Weekday detection</strong>: <code>Weekday(date) &gt;= vbMonday And Weekday(date) &lt;= vbFriday</code></li>
<li><strong>Specific day check</strong>: <code>Weekday(date) = vbMonday</code></li>
<li><strong>ISO week (Monday start)</strong>: Use <code>Weekday(date, vbMonday)</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="typical-uses">Typical Uses</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Weekend Detection</strong>: Determine if a date is Saturday or Sunday</li>
<li><strong>Business Day Calculation</strong>: Check if date is a weekday</li>
<li><strong>Schedule Planning</strong>: Plan events for specific days of the week</li>
<li><strong>Report Grouping</strong>: Group data by day of week</li>
<li><strong>Calendar Display</strong>: Format calendars with proper day alignment</li>
<li><strong>Work Week Calculations</strong>: Calculate working days</li>
<li><strong>Day Name Display</strong>: Get day name with <code>WeekdayName</code> function</li>
<li><strong>Date Validation</strong>: Ensure dates fall on specific days</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="error-handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p>The <code>Weekday</code> function can raise the following errors:

- <strong>Error 5 (Invalid procedure call or argument)</strong>: If firstdayofweek is not between 0 and 7
- <strong>Error 6 (Overflow)</strong>: If date value is too large or too small</p>
<h2 id="performance-notes">Performance Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Very fast operation - direct calculation from date value</li>
<li>No performance difference between firstdayofweek values</li>
<li>Constant time O(1) operation</li>
<li>Can be called repeatedly without performance concerns</li>
<li>Consider caching result if used multiple times with same date</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use named constants</strong> (vbMonday, vbSunday, etc.) instead of numeric values for clarity</li>
<li><strong>Specify firstdayofweek</strong> explicitly when week start matters (especially for ISO weeks)</li>
<li><strong>Cache results</strong> when calling repeatedly with same date</li>
<li><strong>Validate date input</strong> before calling Weekday to avoid errors</li>
<li><strong>Use <code>WeekdayName</code></strong> function to get localized day names</li>
<li><strong>Document assumptions</strong> about which day starts the week in your code</li>
<li><strong>Consider time zones</strong> when working with date/time values</li>
<li><strong>Test boundary cases</strong> (month/year boundaries, leap years)</li>
<li><strong>Use with <code>DateAdd</code></strong> for complex date arithmetic</li>
<li><strong>Handle Null values</strong> explicitly when working with Variant dates</li>
